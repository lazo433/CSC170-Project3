                        <h2> The First <em> Life is Strange </em> </h2>
                    
                        <p> <em> Life is Strange </em> refers to the singular title released in 2015, but also to the entire franchise of games that came afterward. Most of the content on this webpage will focus on the first Life is Strange game, but there will be mentions of consequent games as well. </p>
                    </article>
                    
                        <h2> Conception of <em> Life is Strange </em> </h2>
                        <img src="images/lislogo.jpeg" alt="Life is Strange's Logo" width="348" height="218">
                        <div> The logo to the first game in the <em> Life is Strange </em> franchise </div>
                    
                            <p> Following the critical and commercial failure of their 2013 action-adventure game <em> Remember Me </em>, French game developer Dontnod Entertainment was forced to restructure and reinvent themselves. Dontnod CEO Oskar Guilbert explained "Before, what we wanted to do was make big games with large teams and long production cycles... So we had to change that, do something smaller with smaller teams. We didn’t want to do just a small game; we also wanted to bring something new to the market."
                                <em> Life Is Strange </em> was conceived around the rewind mechanic, a concept which had already been briefly explored in <em> Remember Me </em>. <em> Life Is Strange's </em> protagonist Max Caulfield was created with the ability to rewind time to supplement this mechanism. Development began in April 2013 with a team of 15 people, with further people added as the collaboration with Square Enix began. Before signing with Square Enix, Dontnod imagined <em> Life Is Strange </em> as a full-length video game similar to <em> Remember Me </em> that Dontnod would self-publish; however, Square Enix realized it would be more successful as an episodic title, both for creative reasons, financial restrictions and marketing purposes. This allowed them to tell the story at a slower pace.

                    <h2> Release of <em> Life is Strange </em> </h2>
                    <p> The Pacific Northwest was chosen for the setting to convey a nostalgic and autumnal feel, with the team eventually settling on Oregon as the location of the fictional town of Arcadia Bay. It was decided early on that most of the budget be spent on the writing and voice actors. The story was originally written in French by Jean-Luc Cano, and converted into a game script by the game's co-directors and design team. This was then handed over to Christian Divine and Cano to be finetuned in English. Recording sessions were done in Los Angeles, California, with the French developer brought in via Skype. The textures were hand painted, adapted to achieve what art director Michel Koch called "impressionistic rendering". Sources of inspiration include the visual novel Danganronpa, in terms of balancing gameplay and story, and the novel The Catcher in the Rye, whose protagonist Holden Caulfield shares a surname with Max, the lead character. For the sake of realism, the supernatural elements were designed as a metaphor for the characters' inner conflict,  and experts were consulted to tackle difficult subjects such as teen suicide.
                        Following the release and success of the first <em> Life is Strange </em>, publisher Square Enix chose American developer Deck Nine to develop a prequel game focusing on the life of Chloe Price, while the Dontnod team began developing a direct sequel. Development on the project began in 2016 with assistance from Square Enix' London Studios. Ashly Burch, who voiced Chloe in <em> Life Is Strange </em>, was replaced by Rhianna DeVries due to the SAG-AFTRA strike. However, Burch and Hannah Telle, who voiced Max Caulfield, both reprised their roles for the bonus episode Farewell. The project went under various working titles during development. The writers researched memoirs and psychology to understand Chloe's grieving process, and the script for the game was over 1,500 pages, written by lead writer Zak Garriss and a writers' room. Prior to its official announcement, images had leaked online indicating that a prequel to <em> Life Is Strange </em> was in development. Square Enix revealed <em> Life Is Strange: Before the Storm </em> on 11 June during Microsoft's E3 2017 Presentation.

                <h2>Episodes</h2>

                <h3> <strong> Episode 1: Chrysalis </strong> </h3>

		            <p> The first chapter of the game introduces the player to Max Caulfield, an 18 year old college student. She’s nervous about returning to Arcadia Bay for many reasons, but the main one being her best friend: Chloe Price. When Max and her parents moved to Seattle in 2013, it happened right after the death of her best friend’s dad. Max feels guilty for abandoning Chloe during that time, so she’s anxious about their inevitable reunion. In this chapter, after witnessing the murder of Chloe Price in the school’s bathroom, Max also discovers her ability to rewind time and begins to have visions of a massive tornado destroying Arcadia bay the upcoming Friday. Additionally, we are introduced to the main mystery of Arcadia bay: Rachel Amber. A missing girl and also Chloe’s best friend in Max’s absence. Using her newfound power, she saves Chloe, but doesn’t realize it’ll come with a cost. </p>

	            <h3> Episode 2: Out of Time </h3>

		            <p> After revealing her power to Chloe, the pair of reconciled friends take Max’s rewind ability to the test. In a series of min-games and events, Max tests out her powers and pushes the limits of her abilities. Meanwhile, one of Max’s friends, Kate Marsh, is suffering from depression after a viral video of her at a party is the talk of the school. Throughout the chapter, we see Kate’s well-being deteriorate and eventually culminate in an attempt to take her life. Using her powers, Max stops time completely and manages to make it to Kate to try and save her. Based on the player’s choice throughout the chapter, Kate’s life can either be saved or lost. </p>

	            <h3> Episode 3: Chaos Theory </h3>

		            <p> After the traumatic events that transpired in chapter 2, Chloe tries to comfort Max. However, time is pressing and they still want to find out what happened to Rachel Amber. Their investigation leads them to some unpleasant truths that cause Chloe to spiral. Her and Max get into an argument and when Max returns to her dorm, she reminisces over a picture of her and Chloe as kids. Unintentionally, she discovers a new use of her power and she travels to the time when the picture was taken. She is transported to the day of Chloe’s dad’s death and after changing the course of events, she’s able to save the life of her dad. The changes to her current timeline are completely altered and when she returns to the current day, she finds that Chloe’s father is alive, but Chloe is now completely paralyzed from a car accident she experienced. </p>

	            <h3> Episode 4: Dark Room </h3>

		            <p> After being transported to this alternate reality with a disabled Chloe, Max begins to understand the weight of her powers and tries to find a way back to her original reality. This means returning to the day Chloe’s dad died and letting fate run its course without interference. Back in her reality, Max and Chloe continue their search for Rachel Amber. They are led to an underground bunker where they find evidence of someone drugging young women at parties, then photographing them for sinister purposes. When it happened to Rachel Amber, she was accidentally given a drug too strong and she ended up dying. This revelation breaks Chloe and she becomes hellbent on revenge. They are baited to Rachel’s resting place, where it’s revealed that the academy’s professor is behind everything, but he manages to kill Chloe and drug Max, marking her as his next victim. </p>

	            <h3>  Episode 5: Polarized  </h3>

		            <p> In the final chapter, the storm in Max’s visions finally arrives, but she’s trapped in Mark Jefferson’s bunker. Using her powers, she manages to escape and witness the destruction occurring in Arcadia Bay. After encountering many characters you’ve met throughout the game and living a nightmare sequence brought on by the overuse of her powers, Max must make a final choice. It’s revealed that the reason for the storm started at the beginning of the game, with Max interfering with fate by saving Chloe’s life. In the end, the player must make a choice of sacrificing Arcadia Bay and all of its residents or sacrificing Chloe in order to avoid the storm. This choice is a culmination of all the precious moments spent with Chloe and most players have a hard time choosing who to save. </p>
