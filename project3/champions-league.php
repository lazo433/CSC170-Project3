                    <h2>What is the Champions League?</h2>
                    <p>The <strong>UEFA Champions League</strong> (abbreviated as <strong>UCL</strong>) is an annual club association football competition organized by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) that is contested by top-division European clubs. The competition begins with a <em>round-robin league phase</em> to qualify for the double-legged knockout rounds and a single-leg final. It is the <strong>most-watched club competition</strong> in the world and the <em>third most-watched football competition overall</em>, behind only the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. It is one of the <strong>most prestigious football tournaments</strong> in the world and the <strong>most prestigious club competition in European football</strong>, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations.</p>
                    <p>Introduced in <strong>1955</strong> as the <em>Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens</em> (French for <em>European Champion Clubs' Cup</em>), and commonly known as the <strong>European Cup</strong>, it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues, with its winner recognized as the European club champion. The competition took on its current name in <strong>1992</strong>, adding a <em>round-robin group stage</em> in <strong>1991</strong> and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries since the <strong>1997–98 season</strong>. While only the winners of many of Europe's national leagues can enter the competition, the top 5 leagues by coefficient provide <strong>four teams each</strong> by default, with a possibility for additional spots based on performance during the previous season. Clubs that finish below the qualifying spots are eligible for the second-tier <strong>UEFA Europa League</strong> competition, and since <strong>2021</strong>, for the third-tier <strong>UEFA Conference League</strong>.</p>
                    <p>In its present format, the <strong>Champions League</strong> begins in early <strong>July</strong> with <em>three qualifying rounds</em> and a <em>play-off round</em>, all played over two legs. The <strong>seven surviving teams</strong> enter the league phase, joining <strong>29 teams</strong> qualified in advance. The <strong>36 teams</strong> each play eight opponents, four home and four away. The <strong>24 highest-ranked teams</strong> proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in <strong>late May</strong> or <strong>early June</strong>. The winner of the <strong>Champions League</strong> automatically qualifies for the following year's <strong>Champions League</strong>, the <strong>UEFA Super Cup</strong>, and the <strong>FIFA Club World Cup</strong>.</p>

                        <p>The first time the champions of two European leagues met was in what was nicknamed the <em>1895 World Championship</em> when <strong>English champions Sunderland</strong> beat <strong>Scottish champions Heart of Midlothian</strong> 5&ndash;3. The first pan-European tournament was the <em>Challenge Cup</em>, a competition between clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Three years later, in <strong>1900</strong>, the champions of <strong>Belgium</strong>, <strong>Netherlands</strong>, and <strong>Switzerland</strong>, which were the only existing leagues in continental Europe at the time, participated in the <em>Coupe Van der Straeten Ponthoz</em>, thus being dubbed the <em>"club championship of the continent"</em> by the local newspapers.</p>

                        <h3>The First Cup</h3>
                        <p>The first <strong>European Cup</strong> took place during the <strong>1955&ndash;56 season</strong>. <strong>Sixteen teams</strong> participated (some by invitation): <strong>AC Milan</strong> (Italy), <strong>AGF Aarhus</strong> (Denmark), <strong>Anderlecht</strong> (Belgium), <strong>Djurgården</strong> (Sweden), <strong>Gwardia Warszawa</strong> (Poland), <strong>Hibernian</strong> (Scotland), <strong>Partizan</strong> (Yugoslavia), <strong>PSV Eindhoven</strong> (Netherlands), <strong>Rapid Wien</strong> (Austria), <strong>Real Madrid</strong> (Spain), <strong>Rot-Weiss Essen</strong> (West Germany), <strong>Saarbrücken</strong> (Saar), <strong>Servette</strong> (Switzerland), <strong>Sporting CP</strong> (Portugal), <strong>Reims</strong> (France), and <strong>Vörös Lobogó</strong> (Hungary).</p>
                        <p>The first <strong>European Cup match</strong> took place on <strong>4 September 1955</strong>, and ended in a <strong>3&ndash;3 draw</strong> between <strong>Sporting CP</strong> and <strong>Partizan</strong>. The first goal in European Cup history was scored by <strong>João Baptista Martins</strong> of <strong>Sporting CP</strong>. The inaugural final took place at the <em>Parc des Princes</em> between <strong>Stade de Reims</strong> and <strong>Real Madrid</strong> on <strong>13 June 1956</strong>. The Spanish squad came back from behind to win <strong>4&ndash;3</strong> thanks to goals from <strong>Alfredo Di Stéfano</strong> and <strong>Marquitos</strong>, as well as two goals from <strong>Héctor Rial</strong>. <strong>Real Madrid</strong> successfully defended the trophy against <strong>Fiorentina</strong> next season in their home stadium, the <em>Santiago Bernabéu</em>. After a scoreless first half, <strong>Real Madrid</strong> scored twice in six minutes to defeat the Italians. In <strong>1958</strong>, <strong>Milan</strong> failed to capitalize after going ahead on the scoreline twice, only for <strong>Real Madrid</strong> to equalize. The final, held in <em>Heysel Stadium</em>, went to extra time where <strong>Francisco Gento</strong> scored the game-winning goal to allow <strong>Real Madrid</strong> to retain the title for the third consecutive season.</p>

                        <p>The 1967&ndash;68 season saw Manchester United become the first English team to win the European Cup, beating two-time winners Benfica 4&ndash;1 in the final. This final came ten years after the Munich air disaster, which had claimed the lives of eight United players and left their manager, Matt Busby, fighting for his life. In the 1968&ndash;69 season, Ajax became the first Dutch team to reach the European Cup final, but they were beaten 4&ndash;1 by Milan, who claimed their second European Cup, with Pierino Prati scoring a hat-trick.</p>

                        <p>The 1969&ndash;70 season saw the first Dutch winners of the competition. Feyenoord knocked out the defending champions, Milan in the second round, before beating Celtic in the final. In the 1970&ndash;71 season, Ajax won the title, beating Greek side Panathinaikos in the final.] the season saw a number of changes, with penalty shoot-outs being introduced, and the away goals rule being changed so that it would be used in all rounds except the final. It was also the first time a Greek team reached the final, as well as the first season that Real Madrid failed to qualify, having finished sixth in La Liga the previous season. Ajax went on to win the competition three years in a row (1971 to 1973), which Bayern Munich emulated from 1974 to 1976 before Liverpool won their first two titles in 1977 and 1978.</p>

                    <p>Each year, the winning team is presented with the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the current version of which has been awarded since 1967. From the 1968&ndash;69 season and prior to the 2008&ndash;09 season any team that won the Champions League three years in a row or five times overall was awarded the official trophy permanently. Each time a club achieved this, a new official trophy had to be forged for the following season. Five clubs own a version of the official trophy: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, Milan and Liverpool. Since 2008, the official trophy has remained with UEFA and the clubs are awarded a replica. </p>

                    <h2>Champions League Anthem</h2>
                    <p>The <strong>UEFA Champions League anthem</strong>, officially titled simply as <em>"Champions League"</em>, was written by <strong>Tony Britten</strong>, and is an adaptation of <em>George Frideric Handel's 1727 anthem Zadok the Priest</em> (one of his Coronation Anthems). UEFA commissioned Britten in <strong>1992</strong> to arrange an anthem, and the piece was performed by <em>London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra</em> and sung by the <em>Academy of St. Martin in the Fields</em>. Stating that <em>"the anthem is now almost as iconic as the trophy"</em>, UEFA's official website adds it is <em>"known to set the hearts of many of the world's top footballers aflutter."</em></p>
